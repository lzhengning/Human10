## Introduction

**Human10** is a real-world human body dataset, which contains 10 4D sequences of human actions and 10054 frames in total. 

For each frame, there are **depthmaps** and **masks** of 4 views along with corresponding **triangle meshs**. In addition, 4 fixed **camera calibration parameters** are provided in each sequence.
